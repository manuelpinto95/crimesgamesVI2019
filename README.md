# crimesgamesVI2019
How to run:
- Use the "Web Server for Chrome" extension to open crimesgames.html (after launching the app you can turn off internet connection as everything will be run locally)
- the vis changes depending on the screen resolution and zoom of the browser
- Please use a window zoom of arround 80%. (the choropleth map should fit inside its window)
-There is (very rarely) a bug in the html where sometimes the barchart and the timeline dont render, but cleaning the history and refreshing the page should do the job :)
- ENJOY
